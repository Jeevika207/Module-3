# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 5, 8, 'z')

print("'n' exists in tuple:", 'n' in x)
print("8 exists in tuple:", 8 in x)
```

## Output

## Result

Hence, the code is executed successfully, and the program correctly checks for the existence of the elements `'n'` and `8` in the tuple.
